# libexpat-x86_x64
Visual Studio project files to compile libexpat on Windows

# Background #
libexpat supports compiling on Windows. However, it uses CMake, which
does not produce good solution/projects for Visual Studio.

# Compiling #
This project provides native Visual Studio solution/project files that
can be used to compile libexpat on Windows.

# Installation #
git clone libexpat into a local folder from [libexpat, tested with
v2.2.9](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat)
